label.text1 = In order for the single taxpayer's tax return to be completed correctly, it is necessary to clearly understand the components of income and correctly determine the date of its occurrence. The list of income, as well as amounts that are not part of income or are not income, is given in Art. 292 TCU. According to item 296.1 of Art. 296 TCU single tax payers of the third group (legal entities) use the data of simplified accounting for income, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 44.2 of Art. 44 TCU. The provisions of this paragraph provide for simplified accounting of income and expenses in order to calculate the object of taxation according to the methodology approved by the Ministry of Finance. But the legislation of Ukraine does not contain a regulatory document for accounting for this category of taxpayers.
